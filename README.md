#ClassAppChallenge

ClassApp's DevChallenge consists of creating a program in Node.js which the input defined in 'input.csv', is analyzed and organized in the file 'output.json' following a series of criteria that must be analyzed according to the output pattern, which was determined in the challenge.

It was a fantastic experience to carry out the challenge, as it consists of thoroughly analyzing the expected output, and working to achieve the expected result.

My sincere thanks to the ClassApp team for the opportunity to take on this challenge!
